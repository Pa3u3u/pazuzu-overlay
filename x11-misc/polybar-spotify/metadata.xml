		This polybar module shows details regarding the currently playing song
		on Spotify. The unique feature of this module is that the text displayed
		is constantly scrolled to save space on the bar. This is something that
		is not found in other spotify modules I came across. Also, this module
		uses playerctl to do all the work and hence, no > 100 line scripts which
		do all the work themselves. Only one line to  fetch the required
		metadata in the format that you like and another line to scroll the
		fetched text using zscroll.
